## Synopsis

Newly-hired waitress, Megan, gets a taste of customer service when three elderly men walk into the restaurant one Wednesday morning. Crotchety, persnickety, and eccentric, the three men give Megan a run for her money. In spite of snide remarks by her co-worker, Megan works to be the best server possible and a warm friendship develops.
