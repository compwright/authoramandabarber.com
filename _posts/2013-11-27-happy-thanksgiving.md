It’s the day before Thanksgiving. I’m sitting here at the table, looking out my window while the clouds outside decide whether they will prove the weather man right or wrong about the large quantities of snow he’s predicted we’ll get today. I’m writing a day early because I know tomorrow will be too busy and full of celebration to get this blog post in.

I’m thinking back to a year ago. Years are usually full of unexpected happenings, since we mortals cannot predict the future. But this past year seemed especially full of them, if that makes any sense. Last year about this time, my book finally made its appearance on Amazon. And I was happy...with reservations. After all, nobody knew about my book or who I was besides friends, family and Facebook acquaintances. So, would it do anything useful? Or would it make a little burst and then die a slow but inevitable death? At that point, I really couldn’t tell. A year later, I have seen it make its small burst and slowly and quietly grow. It’s no best seller, but it’s done better than I hoped and I am thankful for that.

I am thankful for God’s provision throughout this year–for giving me the opportunity to do book signings in a number of Barnes and Noble stores, for opportunities to share my faith through talks about what preceded my book, for safety on the road.

But so many things happened beyond the book for which God deserves praise and thanks. The book was simply the icing on the cake.

1. I learned that I can live contentedly as a single woman, that though the desire for marriage and family is still there and will never leave completely, I can be content where God’s placed me.
2. My car lived another year. It’s rustier and noisier than it was last year, but it still gets me from point A to point B. That’s all that counts in my book.
3. I learned that there is no need to feel apologetic for the things I believe God’s Word teaches. Other people may feel I am ridiculous for the things I believe and build my life on, but it neither matters what they think nor whether they misrepresent me to others. My job is to love God’s Word, cherish it, study it and adjust my character until it conforms to it. God will take care of my reputation.
4. True, faithful friends, few and far between. They make promises and keep them. They love with a love that is not blind, which really is the only accurate definition of love. They see my sins and my virtues. They encourage the virtues that God has grown in me and they encourage me to abandon my sin.
5. My computer. Oh, how difficult it would be to write as voluminously as I must without this laptop!
6. For the sudden burst of new music students this Fall. The income helped me foot the ginormous gas bill I got from gallivanting around the countryside to book signings.
7. For many more things that I do not have space to list. 

Thank you, Lord. And thanks to all of you who have sent me encouraging comments and messages through Facebook, email, and in person. You are all so kind. I wish you a Happy Thanksgiving.
