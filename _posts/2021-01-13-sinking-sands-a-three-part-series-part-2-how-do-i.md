excerpt: If you can find your footing on the rock that is Jesus and take your trust
  away from the sinking sands of earthly heroes, political movements, and the existence
  of America as we know it—you will become poised, unflappable, unshakable and…kind.
  Because no one can take your best things away from you. Jesus holds those best things
  in His hand and no power on earth or in Hell can take them away. Period. End of
  story.

###### For those who have never visited my blog before, welcome! I am Amanda (Barber) Hill. I am married to Representative Jonathon Hill of the South Carolina House of Representatives. I don’t state this to brag or name drop, simply to certify that I have been working in the political sphere alongside my husband for the past five years and that I have gained a lot of experience to back up the political advice I will be sharing in these three posts.

After reading yesterday’s post, you may be thinking, “That’s all well and good, but I still feel terrible. I’m still stressed out, and I don’t know how to do this.” I know just how you feel. I have a turbulent personality however calm my exterior looks. I have struggled intensively with anxiety my whole life. Here are some practical suggestions that have helped me:

# Pray

But pray correctly. Don’t demand that God save America by putting Trump back in office. God’s ways are not your ways. Pray that God’s will would be done and ask Him for the help to do His will—the will He clearly lays out for you in His Word. Wherever the Scriptures clearly command or prohibit, just obey. That’s doing the will of God.

# Thank God

There are one hundred things to thank God for every day. When you’re tempted to get on Facebook and make an angry rant. Stop. Turn your mind to thanking God. If you can’t think of anything, thank Him for everything you have enjoyed from the most mundane to the most profound.

* If you enjoyed watching the birds outside your window even for five seconds, thank Him for that experience.
* If your little girl’s smile lit up your morning even if she threw a temper tantrum five minutes later, thank God for that.
* Did your spouse tell you, “I love you” today? Thank God.
* Did a friend express concern for you? Thank God.
* Did your coffee taste especially good? Thank God.

I could go on and on, but I think you get the picture. God blesses you through these tangible things. They are like rays from the sun, as C. S. Lewis once said. They are not the sun proper, but they wouldn’t be there if the sun didn’t exist. Don’t worship the rays. Follow the rays up to the sun and give your thanks there. Follow the sunbeams up to the sun of God’s smile and remember that He sent them because He loves you.

# Rest

Many of you have been off to one Trump rally after another before the election. Afterwards, you went to several more trying to “stop the steal.” You’re tired physically, mentally, and emotionally. On top of that, you have the continued Covid drama, normal family drama, work, school, health difficulties, and a host of other hardships grabbing you by all four limbs and maybe your head, trying to pull you apart. You must rest. I can almost hear you screaming back at me, “But how!!!” I get it. I’m not independently wealthy with the means to run off on a restful vacation currently, either. But there are moments of rest you can grab in between the crazy.

First, quiet your mind. Might I suggest a TV and social media fast? Especially, a fast from all news outlets, talk radio shows and all social media. It will take some self-discipline, but try replacing that constant 24-hour news cycle with better uses of time.

* Soul-nourishing music
* A wholesome novel
* Reading books to your kiddos
* Choosing a verse from the Bible that you stick to the refrigerator and read every time you open it
* Power naps
* Watching movies that are calming and inspiring... are a few suggestions. (It would probably be best to stay away from stuff like the Manchurian Candidate and World War Z at this time. I’ll put my contact info at the end of this post and if you need ideas, I can make some suggestions.) In fact, you might need to have your kids watch a movie so you can power nap! It’s allowed.
* If God has given you creative ability and an outlet and you have the time, do something creative. I find that my mind becomes more focused, stress gets released from my body, and I enjoy a sense of well-being that is hard to match from any other activity.

# Repentance

All of these things I have mentioned above can constitute repentance. I know that sounds odd. We typically think of repentance as falling on your face, beating your breast, tearing clothes, and weeping. And, yes, repentance can look like that depending on circumstances and your particular personality plus cultural moment. But, simply put, repentance is turning away from your error--your missing of the mark-- and turning to Christ to fix your eyes back on Him in simple obedience.

One final note. If you are at all like me, and I suspect I’m not all that strange, you are going to attempt prayer, thanksgiving, and rest and the troubles of the last week will try to invade and stir up anxiety and confusion. “But what if Biden actually gets the presidency?” “But what if we all get censured and our voices are erased?” “What if this is really the end of America?” “What if they stuff us in cattle cars and ship us off to the gulogs?” “What if bad policy ruins us to the extent that there is starvation?” “What if I suffer?”

First of all, none of the steps above erase the very real problems we face. The fact is, we are seeing the early warning signs of the effects of terrible policy that has led to all of the scenarios above in countries all over the world. I am not denying any of that. But I would just like to remind you, once more, of the song I spoke of yesterday.

> “Loving Jesus, gentle lamb
>
> In thy gracious hands I am.
>
> Make me, Savior, what thou art.
>
> Live thyself within my heart.
>
> I shall then show forth thy praise
>
> Serve thee all my happy days.
>
> Then the world shall always see
>
> Christ, the Holy child, in me.”

All of those fears may come true. Things I have feared have happened to me. Even so, you are in the gracious hands of Jesus. Whatever happens, you will be safe in His care. He will be with you in your suffering because He is the God who suffers. Replace your “But what ifs” when they arise to “even ifs.” “Even if Biden gets the presidency, Jesus is in control of America’s rise and fall.” “Even if I get erased from the marketplace of ideas, Jesus hears my voice.” “Even if I go to prison, Jesus will go there with me.” “Even if bad politicians ruin the economy and trigger food shortages and mass starvation, Jesus will provide or He will help me to bear my hunger for as long as is necessary.” “Even if I suffer, Jesus will hold me together in His good hands.”

If you can find your footing on the rock that is Jesus and take your trust away from the sinking sands of earthly heroes, political movements, and the existence of America as we know it—you will become poised, unflappable, unshakable and…kind. Because no one can take your best things away from you. Jesus holds those best things in His hand and no power on earth or in Hell can take them away. Period. End of story.

Now, how do we fight? Because we definitely do fight. Some of the anxiety and defeatism you may be feeling is a consequence of not knowing what you don’t know. Accurate information can go a long way to dispelling unnecessary anxiety, a sense of helplessness, and feelings of overwhelm. Tune back in tomorrow.
