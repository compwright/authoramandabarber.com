excerpt: 'Our love is so strong, it kindled a fire that just about burned the house
  down yesterday. And the neighbor''s house. And the woods. For realz. Well, it really
  had more to do with bad judgement in the face of exhaustion more than love...technically.
  And anyway, couples that put out fires together, stay together. '
