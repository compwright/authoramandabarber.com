Hello, everyone! I’ve been planning to start this blog for quite a long time, so I’m really excited that it’s up and running. Thanks for all of you facebook fans who have visited. Your support is a privilege and a blessing to me.

For those of you who are first-time visitors, I want to thank you as well for taking the time to look around and read, and tell you a little bit about myself. I am the author of one novel, The Pursuit of Elizabeth Millhouse, and another novel is in progress. I began writing with a serious intent towards publication back in 2009. You can read more about that in the post titled, “How it all Began.” My primary goal is to write novels and be published. As of November, I have a literary agent which is a great benefit to me in this publication climate. So, I am making progress in the right direction!

I am also interested in independent Christian film-making. I wrote my first screen-play last summer, and if all goes well, it will be filmed this coming summer.

I am a Christian which provides me with my biggest motivation for writing. Most of all, my life goal is to glorify God, and I believe that one of the ways I can do this most effectively is through writing. I have elaborated on this thought in my post titled, “Why I Have to Write.”

So, thank you for stopping by. Please take a moment to read a story or two and enjoy!
