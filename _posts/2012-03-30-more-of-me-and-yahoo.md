A couple of weeks ago, I accepted a funny short story assignment on Yahoo. I wasn’t sure what to write, because I don’t necessarily think of myself as a comedy writer. On the other hand, I have a registered nurse for a brother who works the night shift. He comes home with the funniest stories sometimes and tells them to me in such an animated fashion, that I often find myself doubled over with tears streaming down my cheeks. So, for this assignment, I took his stories as inspiration and crafted my own crazy “nursing” story. Well, it has clearly hit a chord with more people than I ever suspected. As of last night, the story has received over 40,000 views. I called it [Night Shift at the Hospital](http://web.archive.org/web/20120616122733/http://voices.yahoo.com:80/night-shift-hospital-11005182.html?cat=44) and you can read it today if you like! I also have a few more stories published as well, though they haven’t become the smashing successes “Night Shift” has been. The first is [Justice Peace](http://web.archive.org/web/20140724151936/http://voices.yahoo.com/justice-peace-11001416.html?cat=44), a story about a black cowboy who walks into a small town,  told through the eyes of a lonely young boy. The second is an essay on [the resurrection](http://web.archive.org/web/20121114091422/http://voices.yahoo.com/the-resurrection-11129544.html?cat=37) with an original illustration by a good friend, Robert Hines. The last is a flash fiction story, [Your Dad](http://web.archive.org/web/20140729031047/http://voices.yahoo.com/your-dad-11172226.html), told in one hundred words, focusing on the effects that meth (and really drugs in general) have on innocent children.

So that should give you plenty to read for a while. I have not heard about any further book offers from my agent. I suspect I may hear from him within the month. As soon as I have news, I’ll pass it on to you!
