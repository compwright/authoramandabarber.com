I am a full time student right now. With all these classes to keep up on, I have limited time to write the second novel I started last summer. Fortunately, I’ve found a way around this little dilemma and it just so happens that an English class gave me the opportunity. For this class, I’m actually required to write small articles for Yahoo! Delighted to, I’m sure. So, in the past couple of months, I’ve written and published four. All of them happened to be creative writing assignments, which is my favorite type of writing anyway.  Would you like to read them? Here you go: Last Night, Dreary Lane, The Place, My Girl Lauren

Enjoy!
