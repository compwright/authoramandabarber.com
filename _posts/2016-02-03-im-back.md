excerpt: It has been a long time. Last spring, I took a long break from blogging. I think I gave the excuse that I wanted to get some more book writing done. That was true. But there was another reason, too.

It has been a long time. Last spring, I took a long break from blogging. I think I gave the excuse that I wanted to get some more book writing done. That was true. But there was another reason, too.

Yes, there was a man involved. On December 27, I married him. I seem to have trouble doing more than four or five things well at a time. So, when I took some time off blogging, I was trying to decide whether I ought to marry Jonathon Hill, teaching 38 students, writing assignments for Union Gospel Press, working on my film script, and teaching Sunday School. As you know, I decided to marry him.

Aren’t you glad? Of course, once I decided to marry him in September, I had to plan a wedding for December. (It was either that or wait until June, which simply would not do at all. At thirty years old, both of us felt it was high time to get on with things!) The wedding went off beautifully, thanks to God’s grace and the help of my friends and family. Wasn’t my dress pretty?

So far, these are the only pictures I have to share. But expect I’ll have more share with you in the coming weeks. There might even be a video.

How did we meet? Well, you can read that story here. Jonathon is in the South Carolina House of Representatives. He is in session from January to June for three days a week. I am, in fact, typing this from the house floor. He likes me to join him there from time to time to watch the proceedings. It’s interesting, though I usually have about a ten-minute struggle between my desire to be a supportive wife and my equally strong desire not to be conspicuous. During the days he’s not at the capitol, Jonathon does nerdy computer stuff.

Cora has grown quite fond of him. In fact, just this morning, she did the unheard-of . She flew from my shoulder across the room to land on Jonathon’s—not once but twice. I think he’s a winner.

As you might have already surmised, I have moved from my lovely Michigan lake town, St. Joseph, to Jonathon’s home in Townville, SC. In fact, before I get into all that, why don’t I just tell you what has happened since my wedding. We headed off to our honeymoon (a cabin in the woods a few hours away), traveled back to St. Joseph to pack up the rest of my stuff, drove the twelve hours south to my new home, proceeded from there to Columbia for the opening of the legislative session, from there we drove to Atlanta where we barely caught our flight to San Francisco (there’s a whole blog post I could write about that). After a few days there, we flew to Japan, flew from Japan to Manila (the Philippines), then from Manila to Dumaguete where we met my brother, Justin, and his fiancé, Felis. (Oh, did I tell you that my brother also got married?)

Nice-looking couple, aren’t they?

At that point, we hopped on a bus and bounced, jolted, and swerved for three hours to our destination on the island of Negros Oriental, Felis’ hometown of Basay. At the end of that week, Felis and Justin were wed and we began our long journey back to the states. From Dumaguete we flew to Manila, then to Guam, then to Honolulu, then to San Francisco, then to Los Angeles, then to Atlanta. (The tickets were cheap.) From there back to Townville where I promptly fell ill and laid around on the couch for the next two days. Suffice it to say that I do not intend to look at the inside of an airport or set foot on another airplane for at least a year.

I am still uncertain about how often I’ll be writing new entries. After one rather crazy month of marriage, I’m not yet sure what is a reasonable frequency. But I can say that it will be far more frequent than once every six months!

Thanks for reading, and I’ll see you all in print as soon as I can.

Yours truly,

Amanda B….Hill, I mean
