I first began teaching music in Michigan as a 25-year-old violinist, pianist and singer. Over the course of five years, my music studio grew to about forty students. What began as a way of funding my college education turned into a full time job that I really loved.

When I got married and moved to South Carolina, I really missed the kids and the relationships that had developed between me and their families. So, I’m taking students again and building my studio here in South Carolina.

### I teach:

* Voice
* Violin
* Piano

If you are in the Upstate are of South Carolina and are interested in music lessons for yourself or your child, you can contact me through my music studio page:

## Musical experience

Both of my parents are gifted musicians who teach out of their own private studio. My mother, Nancy Barber, is a cellist who has played in many orchestras over the years. My father, Richard Joseph Barber, is a classically trained baritone, pianist, and composer. He has led many church choirs and is currently the choir director for High Country Baptist Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Needless to say, I was immersed in this musical environment from the time I was born. Singing as a family at home in four-part harmony and in churches was a way of life! I began learning piano and violin at a young age and had a number of really excellent teachers.

In 2008, I joined the [Kalamazoo Philharmonia](https://reason.kzoo.edu/philharmonia/) under Andrew Koehler and had the pleasure of performing such orchestral works as Stravinsky's _The Rite of Spring_, _Taras Bulbas_ by Janáček, _Symphonie Fantastique_ by Berlioz, Brahms' _Requiem_, and many more. My skill as a violinist grew by leaps and bounds during this time.

Starting in 2011, I began offering private lessons and my studio grew to around 40 students. During that time, I continued to perform at church and gave several solo concerts.

My husband Jonathon and I were married in 2015 and I moved down to South Carolina, where I've played an active role in our church's music programs, including leading our children's choir.

Most recently in 2018, Jonathan and I started [Barber Music Company](https://www.patreon.com/barbermusiccompany) to publish and promote my dad’s compositions. We hosted a concert titled [_The Father Sent the Son_](http://barbermusic.events/) featuring his music in December of 2018.

In 2019, at the invitation of [Dr. Bob Heritage](https://www.gamac.org/leaders), Jonathon and I joined the Concert of Hope choir, which gives annual benefit concerts for the [Anderson Cancer Association](http://www.cancerassociationanderson.org/).

## Philosophy of Music

Classical music provides the foundation upon which any musical style can be built. I start out all my students in classical, traditional and sacred music as soon as I can get them there. After students have a firm grasp of their musical foundation, they are equipped to branch out into any genre they wish.

For that reason, I do not teach pop music as a general rule to my piano or violin students, or belting and other pop music techniques to my voice students.

## Studio Policy

### Eligibility

I will teach any child who knows his alphabet and can count to ten, and I’ll teach any age after that, including adults.

### Lesson Length

Lessons are usually 30 minutes. As a student progresses, he/she may want longer lessons. I am quite flexible and can work that out with you. Depending on interest, I can also offer group lessons for violin and voice.

### Recitals

Public performance is a vital part of musical mastery. I give a recital every spring so that students can demonstrate and share what they’ve learned with their friends and families.

Here's one of my piano students, Lucien Witmer, at the Spring 2015 recital:

### Tuition

Tuition is $100 per month for four lessons and is non-refundable.

### Cancellation Policy

Please give 24 hours notice before cancelling a lesson. If life happens, and you have a flat tire on the way to a lesson or a feverish child prevent you from canceling before that 24 hour mark, we can schedule a make up lesson.

### Family Involvement

I love families. Parents and siblings of students are welcome to come along to lessons. There are two reasons for this.

First, it’s important for parents to observe lessons so that they know how to help their children practice during the week, what they should be practicing, and how they should be practicing.

Second, I do not want unnecessary impediments in the way of children getting music lessons. You should not have to get a babysitter in order for your oldest child to have music lessons. Bring your kids along! As long as they are not disrupting the lesson, they are more than welcome to read books, play quietly, color pictures, work on homework, etc…
