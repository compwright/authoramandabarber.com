I began teaching music in Michigan as a 25-year-old violinist, pianist and singer. Over the course of five years, my music studio grew to about forty students. What began as a way of funding my college education turned into a full time job that I really loved. I so enjoy teaching and working with kids that when I got married and moved to South Carolina, I really missed the kids and the relationships that had developed between me and their families. Now I’m hoping to build a studio here in Townville, SC!

## Philosophy of Music

My philosophy of music, simply put, is that classical music provides the foundation upon which any musical style can be built. I start out all my students in classical, traditional and sacred music as soon as I can get them there. After students have a firm grasp of their musical foundation, they are equipped to branch out into any genre they wish. For that reason, I do not teach pop music as a general rule to my piano or violin students, or belting and other pop music techniques to my voice students.

I also believe it’s important for students to put their new-found skills into action! I give a recital every spring so that students can demonstrate and share what they’ve learned with their friends and families.

## Family Involvement

I love families. I encourage parents and students’ siblings to come along on lessons. There are two reasons for this: First, it’s important for parents to observe lessons so that they know how to help their children practice during the week, what they should be practicing, and how they should be practicing. Second, I do not want unnecessary impediments in the way of children getting music lessons. You should not have to get a babysitter in order for your oldest child to have music lessons. Bring your kids along! As long as they are not disrupting the lesson, they are more than welcome to read books, play quietly, color pictures, work on homework, etc…

## Musical experience

My mother is a cellist who has played in a number of orchestras over the years, teaches cello and piano, and frequently gives solo recitals. My father is a baritone, pianist, and composer and has taught private voice and piano lessons and runs a business as a piano tuner. He also taught in public and private schools, leading bands, choirs, and directing musicals. He has led many church choirs and is currently the choir director of High Country Baptist Church. He has written many sacred works for choirs, soloists, and instrumentalists.

I was immersed in this musical environment from the time I was born. Singing as a family at home in four-part harmony and in churches was a way of life! I began learning piano and violin at a young age and had a number of really excellent teachers. In 2008, I became a member of the Kalamazoo Philharmonia and had the pleasure of performing such orchestral works as The Rite of Spring by Stravinsky, Taras Bulbas by Janacek, Symphonie Fantastique by Berlioz, the Brahms Requiem, and many more. That experience grew my skills as a violinist by leaps and bounds.

I began teaching privately in 2011 and my studio grew to around 40 students. During that time, I also sang in my church choir, performed solos, and gave several solo concerts.

Most recently, my husband and I have started Barber Music Company in order to promote my dad’s musical compositions and make them available to church musicians and choir directors. We were thrilled to give a concert of his music this last December at St. John’s United Methodist Church in Anderson, SC! My husband and I are also privileged to sing in a choir that will be giving the Concert of Hope on September 14 in Anderson!

## Instruments I Teach

I teach voice, violin and piano. I will teach any child who knows his alphabet and can count to ten, and I’ll teach any age after that, including adults. Depending on interest, I can also offer group violin lessons and group voice lessons.

## Lesson Length

30 minutes. As a student progresses, he/she may want longer lessons. I am quite flexible and can work that out with you.

## Tuition

I charge a monthly tuition of 100 dollars.

## Cancellation Policy

I ask that you give me 24 hours notice before cancelling a lesson and I do not refund money for lessons canceled. But life happens, and should a flat tire on the way to a lesson or a feverish child prevent you from canceling before that 24 hour mark, we can work to schedule a make up lesson.
