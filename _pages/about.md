Amanda Barber is the author of numerous short stories and essays. In 2009, Amanda collaborated with her brother, Justin Barber, to produce an album of original compositions with a complimentary narrative, entitled Children’s Suite. Early in 2011, she wrote and co-produced a radio broadcast which aired on 106.7 FM Radio Harbor Country, Three Oaks, MI. She recently completed …her first novel, The Pursuit of Elizabeth Millhouse, and is currently seeking publication. Her next novel, 27, is in progress.

Amanda has a keen interest in writing for films. This summer she wrote a short film script called, The Wednesday Morning Breakfast Club. The film is currently in pre-production and is tentatively set for shooting in the summer of 2012.

Amanda’s interest in writing began at Christmas of 1997 when she pulled a journal out of her stocking. She began her writing career by chronicling all her Christmas presents in the first entry. From there, she branched out into short stories and novelettes. It was in the fall of 2009 that she took one of those novelettes and developed it into the novel, The Pursuit of Elizabeth Millhouse.

Amanda is first and foremost a Christian, and her writing reflects this. It is her desire to provide captivating fiction that entertains while it encourages other Christians to hold to the truth and keep close to God.

In her spare time, Amanda loves to read, sew, cook, go for long walks, and spend time with friends and family. Music is a great love, as well. She plays the violin in the Kalamazoo Philharmonia, teaches private violin and piano lessons, and listens to classical music.

Currently, Amanda is pursuing a bachelor’s degree in technical and professional communications through Ferris State University. This degree focuses on the business aspect of writing, which Amanda feels is important to produce a well-rounded set of writing skills.
