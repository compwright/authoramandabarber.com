Dear Governor McMaster,

You are a busy man, so I will get straight to the point. Although I look as healthy as a horse, I have had some severe health struggles over the past ten years that have landed me in the high-risk category should I contract Covid-19.

However, l believe it is patently unfair to ask healthy people to stay at home and lose their jobs, their homes, their health insurance, and eventually their lives just to keep people like me from contracting Covid-19.

Please consider that economic depressions kill people. If we continue on this course, thousands of small businesses in South Carolina will be forced to close permanently. Consider that loss of livelihood inevitably leads an increase in alcohol abuse, drug abuse, and suicide.

Next month, the man who lost his job this week will use the last dollar in his bank account. His children will still be hungry, his mortgage/rent, electric bill, water bill, taxes, and health insurance bills will still be due. When he puts a gun to his head to end it all, I can guarantee you his last thought will not be, “Thank God I didn’t die of Covid-19.”

Those of us who are immunocompromised or suffering other underlying health conditions can still afford to stay home…as long as those supporting us can still work.

Please end the shut down now. Because all businesses are essential to someone.

With Respect,

Amanda Hill
